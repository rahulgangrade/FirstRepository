We are developing a tool that maps out the rules in our system and assesses whether our current scripts provide adequate coverage.”

“We are building a solution to catalogue rule conditions and verify that existing automation scripts address each one.”

“Our focus is on creating a mechanism to identify rule-based conditions and evaluate if our test scripts cover them comprehensively.”

“We’re implementing a framework to track rule conditions and determine the extent of script coverage across those conditions.”

“We’re establishing a process to extract rule conditions and validate the degree to which existing scripts fulfill those requirements.”

“We are setting up a utility that highlights rule conditions and assesses whether our current scripting aligns with those conditions.”

“We are initiating development of a system that identifies rule conditions and audits existing scripts for coverage gaps.”

“Our initiative is to develop a functionality which identifies all rule conditions and checks their coverage within our script base.”

“We are working on a tool that identifies the set of rule conditions and measures how effectively our existing scripts satisfy them.”

“We are creating a coverage-assessment utility to identify rule conditions and determine whether our automation scripts adequately address each one.”
